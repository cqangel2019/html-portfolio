<h1>The Best Movies According to Carl</h1>
<h2>My top 3 movies of all time.</h2>
<hr \>
<h3>Raiders of the Lost Ark</h3>
<p>The most perfect popcorn movie of all time. I saw this movie alone at the movie theater when I was 11 and I was never the same again.John Williams' music had a lot to do with it.</p>
<h3>Field of Dreams</h3>
<p>So easily could have been hokey. An incredible story of fathers and sons where baseball is a metaphor for communication and reciprocation of affection. Treads a delicate balance. How can any movie whose last line, "Hey, dad, you want to have a catch?" succeed in total and not seem like a corny line?</p>
<h3>Tootsie</h3>
<p>I never thought that a film about a guy who dresses like a woman would be my go-to feel good movie whenever I feel bad, but Larry Gelbart's screenplay and all the performances are perfection.</p>
