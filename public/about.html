<h1>About Me</h1>
<p>Carl Angel is a visual artist who enjoys creating and participating in narrative and storytelling in various forms - be it commercial illustration, children's books, design or a series of paintings exploring personal themes.</p>

<p>His latest effort is a series of illustrations for a documentary on the legendary Chang Apana. Apana was the inspiration for the Charlie Chan novels and films, but his real story is FAR more interesting. Check out the video to see what’s in store. It’s a tremendous effort and it takes no less a talent than Lawrence Pacheco, a seasoned documentarian who is fantastic at bringing the past to life. I’m so honored to work with him on this project!</p>

<p>He also just published his latest illustrated childdren's book, Pedro's Yo-Yos, which received a positive review on Booklist: The concise text, which nicely encapsulates key moments from Flores’ life, is beautifully accompanied by Angel’s naturalistic and expressive digital paintings, especially when depicting Flores’ impressive yo-yo tricks.</p>
